# Cluster-Api-Intro

Hey folks! I've created a get started with Cluster-API repo that you can use to bootstrap a cluster in AWS with kind. Feel free to use and modify this as need and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need some help or have questions.

Cluster API is a fast moving project, don't expect this repo to necessarily stay up to date. Please open an issue if you want it brought up to current at some point in the future.
